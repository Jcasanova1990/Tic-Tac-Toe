Gameplay:

Players take turns placing their symbol ("X" or "O") in an empty square within the grid.
The first player (whoever is "X") starts the game.
Objective:

The goal is to be the first player to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Turns:

Each player takes turns placing their symbol in an empty square of the grid.
Once a symbol is placed in a square, it cannot be moved.
Winning:

If a player successfully gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game.
If all squares are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
End of Game:

The game ends when a player wins or when all squares are filled without a winner (a draw).
Restart:

If players want to play again, they can clear the grid and start a new game.
Example Gameplay:

Player 1 (X) places an "X" in an empty square.
Player 2 (O) places an "O" in an empty square.
Players continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
Remember, Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game that requires players to anticipate their opponent's moves while planning their own. Enjoy playing!
